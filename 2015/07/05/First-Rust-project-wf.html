            <div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps one of the most exciting languages I&#8217;ve had hands on since Haskell, or maybe even Lisp, Rust has had my eye since at least 0.10. The promise of a C competitor systems language, with an ML-inspired type system, and lots of functional tools was intriguing as hell, and I&#8217;ve kept watch for a stable release, intent on checking things out once they settled down a little.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With Rust 1.0 finally stable and released, I finally sat down a few weeks ago and started digging into the literature in my off hours. I dove into the brilliant <a href="http://rustbyexample.com/">Rust By Example</a> book, and couldn&#8217;t stop reading. I literally read every last entry, fiddled with the code samples, and generally was excited more and more with every page. It&#8217;s honestly one of the only programming books I&#8217;ve ever finished cover to cover (metaphorically speaking of course, what with it being an interactive web book and all). It&#8217;s a brilliant piece of work, one of the best learning tools for a programming language I&#8217;ve seen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I of course followed it up with some readings from <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Book</a>, doing a few of the tutorials, as well as a few of the <a href="http://exercism.io">exercism</a> challenges, and bounced around thoughts for a few different project ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the end, it was one of <a href="http://exercism.io/submissions/bcdad67b3093490c86801cd5ef43cba4">those exercism challenges</a> that gave me a good quick "weekend project" idea. The challenge was to write a function to count word frequencies, and I was proud enough of the resulting code to want to turn it into an actual utility.</p>
</div>
<div id="app-listing" class="listingblock">
<div class="title">word_count.rs</div>
<div class="content">
<pre>// Word count

use std::collections::HashMap;

pub fn word_count(s: &amp;str) -&gt; HashMap&lt;String, u32&gt; {
    s.split(|c: char| !c.is_alphanumeric())
        .filter( |s| !s.is_empty() )
        .map(|s| { s.chars().flat_map(char::to_lowercase).collect::&lt;String&gt;() })
        .fold(HashMap::new(), |mut m, i| {
            *m.entry(i).or_insert(0u32) += 1;
            m
        })
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It turns out, there isn&#8217;t actually a standard Unix utility for doing this, though it&#8217;s possible through various pipelines with the existing tools, so I wrote one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>wf (<a href="https://github.com/jarcane/wf">Github link</a>) is a simple Unix-style command-line utility in the spirit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wc_%28Unix%29">wc</a> that takes a stream of text on stdin, and returns a list of word frequencies. In total, it&#8217;s only about 120 lines of pure Rust, and even includes a couple options (for counting or skipping numbers, and even sorting). No man-page or install script yet; I don&#8217;t actually have a *nix install at the moment, so it&#8217;d be hard to test, but if anyone wants to bundle it up themselves I&#8217;m happy to take pull requests or suggestions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, I am left with just as much enthusiasm for Rust as I had when I started. There&#8217;s some odd quirks to it, in particular it&#8217;s not always strictly possible to follow a purely functional style; there&#8217;s still some methods in the standard lib that are purely imperative in nature or require mutation. The memory model takes some getting used to as well, and I still find myself battling with the compiler sometimes, but crucially I generally find that once I find the solution (or get help with it, more on that in a moment), it almost always makes perfect sense.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general though, it&#8217;s a cool language. It feels like C hacking, but with all the functional and type system toys I love, and as a result manages to trip every happy button in my little programmer brain at once in a way no language has since Racket. Everything largely feels <a href="http://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/218040.html">very well thought out</a>, lacking quite so many weird niggles and shoot-your-foot surprises.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps the best part for me too has been the community. The Rust team have committed to creating a very welcoming, helpful environment, and it has paid dividends. If I have a question, someone will answer, and even be willing to walk me through things. It&#8217;s amazing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Honestly, the whole ecosystem just feels like Rust has nailed on all fronts "what programming is supposed to be like" as well as anyone could.</p>
