            <div class="paragraph">
<p>In the wake of recent events in the gaming sphere, I&#8217;ve been thinking a
good hard think. Harassment on the internet is becoming a major societal
problem. People&#8217;s lives are being threatened. Women are bombarded with
abuse on an unconscionable scale. Something needs to be done: we can
talk until we&#8217;re blue in the face about why sending someone violent
threats and harassment is wrong, but the harassers aren&#8217;t listening.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What we need, is an abuse filter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the public birth of the internet, millions, possibly even billions
of dollars have been spent in pursuit of building a better spam filter.
Countless man-hours have been dedicated to finding new ways of
identifying and properly filing away to /dev/null the endless torrent of
garbage emails about Viagra and Nigerian princes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And yet, where are the millions spent on solutions for internet
harassment? The countless man-or-woman-hours poured into making life on
the internet less an endless free-fire zone for abusive sociopaths?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most existing social media systems rely entirely on user reporting,
essentially leaving it to the user to manually report and block each and
every abusive message. This is about as ludicrous a task to demand as it
would be for spam. Especially for those targeted by concerted campaigns
like #gamergate/#quinnspiracy, this is more or less an intractable
problem. Props aplenty for the courage of women like Zoe Quinn and Anita
Sarkeesian who&#8217;ve stuck it out and even done that work, but they never
should&#8217;ve had to do it in the first place, and many choose simply to
leave rather than deal with it. Some very talented women and men alike
have literally quit gaming entirely over this kind of harassment, and
similar incidents have occured elsewhere in any number of fields.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What we need is something that takes the burden of policing one&#8217;s own
timelines and inboxes off of the user, just as spam filters do for
advertising and scams.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But there&#8217;s an important difference here: ignoring spam has little
consequence. Ignoring violent threats can be dangerous, and even
ignoring mundane harassment often sends the message that such behavior
is itself without consequence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus unlike a spam filter which simply consigns a useless message to a
dustbin, an abuse filter would need to properly file and report abusive
and threatening messages, possibly even for reporting to legal
authorities. It needs to be smart enough to know not just what an
abusive message is, but what to <em>do</em> about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This also would require some cooperation from service providers,
however, not all of which even provide such avenues. A Twitter client,
for instance, would need to be able to report a user as abusive, yet the
Twitter APIs, that I can see, do not appear to support reporting a user
for abuse, only for spam.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am just one guy, a relative amateur at that. This is a large problem
that will require brilliant minds, lots of man hours, and probably more
resources than I have at my disposal. But that doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t get
it started. I intend to take a crack at developing a simple filtering
engine to file and classify abusive messages given the pair of an
identifying username and the text of the message. I&#8217;ll be doing it in
Racket, because I think the tools Racket offers for parsing might offer
some clever avenues for solutions to such problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s likely to be unimpressive, and it&#8217;s likely to bring grumbles about
the choice of language, the simplicity of the model, and on and on.
That&#8217;s the point. Consider it my challenge. A first effort to get the
ball rolling, with the tacit expectation that you indeed can do better:
so prove it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Work begins soon, announcements and github repo pending. Let&#8217;s help make
the internet a better place to be.</p>
