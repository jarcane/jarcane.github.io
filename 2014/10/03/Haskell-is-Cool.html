            <div class="paragraph">
<p>After my last post and some thinking, I ultimately settled on <em>Learn You
a Haskell</em> as my next book to work through, and after some initial
hassles trying to get a decent working environment set up, I must say
that I&#8217;m quite enjoying the language itself. It was running across
<a href="http://tryhaskell.org/">Try Haskell</a> that actually spurred me to finally
take the leap in that direction (seriously, online REPLs are the best
language demos period), and I was quickly impressed by the power hiding
in that seemingly obtuse syntax.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And of course, like everyone else ever (so many that <em>Learn You a
Haskell</em> actually makes a bit of a joke out of it), I was impressed as
hell with the Haskell quicksort solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But after some tinkering in Racket, not for precisely the same reasons
as the book uses it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For reference, the Haskell recursive quicksort looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell">quicksort :: (Ord a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
quicksort [] = []
quicksort (x:xs) =
    let smallerSorted = quicksort [a | a &lt;- xs, a &lt;= x]
        biggerSorted = quicksort [a | a &lt;- xs, a &gt; x]
    in smallerSorted ++ [x] ++ biggerSorted</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I know, right? It&#8217;s short and sweet, and using multiple recursion and
list filtering to solve it takes a hell of a lot of the work out of it.
Hell, this is actually the first version of quicksort I&#8217;ve ever
understood; though in my defense the last time I tried to write a
quicksort was some 15 years ago as a teenage BASIC hacker (I failed.
Repeatedly.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The book of course uses it as an example of the power of recursion, and
it is indeed a good example of where clever use of that can do a lot in
very little space (though personally I think the lazy factorial method
is a cooler example), but the thing is that any language that implements
good recursion can do the same algorithm and just as fast.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For instance, Racket can do the exact same algorithm in just a few more
lines (most of them in this case for clarity and convenience,
semantically it&#8217;s <em>almost</em> identical [but not quite, and I&#8217;ll get to
why]).</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-scheme" data-lang="scheme">(define (qs lst)
  (if (empty? lst)
      lst
      (let* ((hd (car lst))
             (tl (cdr lst))
             (smaller (qs (for/list ((i tl) #:when (&lt;= i hd)) i)))
             (larger (qs (for/list ((i tl) #:when (&gt; i hd)) i))))
         (flatten (cons smaller (cons hd larger))))))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So clearly, it&#8217;s not exactly the <em>recursion</em> that makes the example so
cool. No, what makes the Haskell version cool is when you realize what
it can do that our Racket port can&#8217;t: anything but numbers. The Haskell
quicksort can readily handle numbers, strings, or lists of chars, all
thanks to the power of this line right here:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell">quicksort :: (Ord a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Especially</em> the <code>(Ord a)</code> bit: that&#8217;s the Ord typeclass, which imports
types that Haskell knows how to put in order, thus allowing a statically
typed language to still nonetheless use the same &#8656; operator regardless
of what type is actually being fed it (the other part of that feat is
the <code>[a]</code> bit, the generics).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be able to get a similarly powerful, if not as convenient function,
we have to upgrade our Racket version a bit:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-scheme" data-lang="scheme">(define (qs-2 fun lst)
  (if (empty? lst)
      lst
      (let* ((hd (car lst))
             (tl (cdr lst))
             (smaller (qs (for/list ((i tl) #:when (fun i hd)) i)))
             (larger (qs (for/list ((i tl) #:when ((negate fun) i hd)) i))))
        (flatten (cons smaller (cons hd larger))))))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now our Racket quicksort has become a higher-order function, and must be
passed the less-than function it will use to find <em>smaller</em> as well as
negate to find <em>larger</em>. But it&#8217;s still not exactly replicated the
feat that Haskell&#8217;s version would, and doing so directly would mean a
whole range of type checks. It is almost certainly possible, but not in
so concise a manner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And of course, some of this difference comes from Haskell&#8217;s special
little rules, like lists being mono-typed elements (as opposed to
Racket&#8217;s free-wheeling ones); this is more limiting but also means that
functions like quicksort can largely be written to assume a list will
behave with it. If we pass it a list from elsewhere in our program, it
will still work as long as its members are members of Ord.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The amusing footnote to this is that the easy solution for Racket is to
make it a higher-order function (and in fact, this is even what Racket&#8217;s
built-in sort does), whereas in <em>Learn You a Haskell</em> the author doesn&#8217;t even get to
higher-order functions until the chapter after the quicksort example.</p>
