<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was discussed recently on the #racket freenode channel that getting
going with Frog might actually be a bit tricky for someone not coming
from the Racket ecosystem or unfamiliar with Github Pages. The process
is actually pretty straightforward, but the steps involved aren&#8217;t
exactly documented anywhere in one place, and I promised to look into
remedying that. Arcane Syntax itself is hosted on GHP, and generated
with Frog, so I had some experience in getting it all working and
thought I could help.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Read on past the jump for a quick guide to building a blog in Frog and
hosting it on Github Pages.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="step-1-install-racket">Step 1: Install Racket</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frog is powered by the Racket programming language, and is currently
available primarily as a package for Racket, so we&#8217;ll need that. You can
download Racket for your platform, be it *nix, Mac, or Windows, from
their <a href="http://download.racket-lang.org/">web site</a>. If you&#8217;re on a Linux
or BSD, you might also check your package repo for it, but be sure it&#8217;s
up-to-date: Frog needs Racket 6, and I know at least Debian is still
only hosting 5.x.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Crucially here, you also need to make sure that Racket&#8217;s root directory
is available in your command-line path. Unixen should take care of this
automatically, but Windows will need it added to the $PATH if we want
this to be a painless process. You&#8217;ll need to go to the System Control
Panel, Advanced System Settings, Environment Variables, and edit Path to
include "C:\Program Files\Racket" for 64-bit Racket or "C:\Program Files (x86)\Racket" for 32-bit.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="step-2-install-frog">Step 2: Install Frog</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As long as Step 1 has gone fine, this part is easy. Go to your command
line and do <code>raco pkg install frog</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>raco is the Racket command-line swiss army knife, used for everything
from compiling executables to installing packages; it&#8217;ll also be your
interface for Frog commands too, now that it&#8217;s installed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="step-3-make-a-github-account">Step 3: Make a Github Account</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> is a service for hosting source repositories
managed by the Git version control system. You can create a new account
right from the main page, picking a username, email, and password. It&#8217;ll
ask you what plan you wish to use, with Free as an option so long as you
don&#8217;t mind all your repos being public. It will also send an email to
whatever account you gave it, to verify that email for future use for
things like password recovery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>NOTE:</em> By default, the email address you give Github will be publicly
posted on your account profile. If you don&#8217;t want this to happen, once
you&#8217;ve verified your email address, you can tell it to 'keep my email
address private' on the email settings page.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="step-4-install-git">Step 4: Install Git</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll also need to install Git, because as the previous step alluded
to, it&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to use to manage and sync our changes to the
blog whenever we generate a new post and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re on Windows, the path of least resistance here is just to
install the <a href="http://windows.github.com">Github for Windows</a> client. Ditto
for Macs, which have their <a href="https://mac.github.com/">own client</a>. It&#8217;s not
without it&#8217;s wrinkles, but for our purposes it is dead easy. Otherwise,
if we&#8217;re on Unixen, we&#8217;ll probably need to install it from our package
repo of choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll also need to do some additional setup things as well, like
creating an SSH key for using Git and stuff, which I am going to pass
along to the absolutely excellent
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/">Github Tutorial page</a> on
setting up Git.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="step-5-make-a-repo-for-your-page">Step 5: Make a Repo for your page</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re logged in to Github, you can just click on the little + symbol
on the top bar of the site and choose "New Repository".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the name, we want to name it after the URL we&#8217;re going to use to get
to our new blog. Github does a really cool thing where a
<em>username</em>.github.com repo will be automatically uploaded and hosted
at that URL. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll name our repo, using the username we
chose in Step 3.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s up to you whether you want it to be public or private, but the
latter option is only available if you pay for hosting. You can also
provide a description. Don&#8217;t worry about the .gitignore and license
stuff, and we don&#8217;t really need to make a README either. We actually
want our new repo completely empty.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="step-6-make-the-local-mirror-of-our-blog">Step 6: Make the local mirror of our Blog</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Guess what! See that page that just appeared when we started an empty
repo? It happens to be a complete set of instructions to link our online
repository to a local folder on our computer. We just have to know a
little bit more on what to do with them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re on Windows or Mac, and you&#8217;ve installed the Github client,
this is easy as can be: click that green button. If you&#8217;ve followed the
set up instructions I linked in Step 4, that should open it up in our
Github client and let us create a local "clone" of our online repo.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re on Unixen, we want to do the thing it says there under "or
create a new repository on the command line", save that it&#8217;s left out an
important step: we need to make a folder for all this to happen in! So
we revise the instructions too:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>mkdir [username].github.com
cd [username].github.com
touch README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/frogtutorial/frogtutorial.github.com.git
git push -u origin master</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Substitute <code>[username]</code> for the name you used on Github.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="step-7-build-our-new-blog">Step 7: Build our new blog</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Navigate to the directory you created in the previous step in your
favorite command-line shell, and do <code>raco frog --init</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frog will now build all the requisite template files to generate your
new blog! These will all be on defaults, of course, but you can even run
<code>raco frog -bp</code> and it will build and open your blog in your web browser
running on a local webserver. Neat! Hit Ctrl-C to stop the server if you
don&#8217;t want it to stay running.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="step-8-customize-our-blog">Step 8: Customize our Blog</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Right now though, our blog is pretty generic. It&#8217;s all on defaults! We
can change some of the most common settings and details from the
<code>.frogrc</code> file that lives in the root of our site folder. Open it up in
your favorite text editor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Crucially, we really need to change the URL, to match the URL of our
Github page: <code>http://[username].github.com</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also change the title and author here, as well as some settings
about how Frog generates pages, which are all helpfully described right
there in the file. We don&#8217;t really need to mess with any of them for now
though.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can also tell it which text editor we use, by giving it the name of
the executable. This is useful because we can follow up with some
helpful frog command to open the editor to the last new post we told it
to make.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default templates that Frog uses to generate pages are also
tweakable, if you know some HTML and so forth, and it uses Bootstrap for
making a pretty site; so you can use Bootstrap templates like those on
<a href="http://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a> to jazz it up from the basic
template. I&#8217;ve also written a short little guide for setting up
<a href="http://jarcane.github.io/blog/2014/09/16/disqus-comments-with-frog.html">Disqus
comments</a> properly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="step-9-generate-a-new-post">Step 9: Generate a new post</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So let&#8217;s make a post to our new blog! Once more from our blog&#8217;s home
folder, we can do <code>raco frog -n "[post title]"</code>. It will helpfully
display the name of the Markdown file it just generated to be the
template of our new post.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can open up this .md file in your favorite text editor or run
<code>raco frog --edit</code> if we&#8217;ve set that up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frog files are in the form of Markdown, which is a handy little markup
language invented by John Gruber that makes pretty looking text files
that also parse semi-easily to equally pretty HTML. Mr. Gruber has a
helpful guide for the basics on his page defining
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown syntax</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A new Frog post already includes some boilerplate stuff: a block at the
top with title, date/time, and tags, some filler text, and a <code>more</code> tag
for marking a break in the text between what&#8217;s shown in your main blog
page and what&#8217;s only shown by clicking through to individual posts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The filler text can be replaced, the more tag removed or placed where
you like, but crucially, you <em>MUST</em> change the DRAFT tag to something
else, or else Frog will skip it when you build the blog!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="step-10-build-your-blog">Step 10: Build your blog</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Save your text file, and now we can rebuild the blog to include it. Do
the following on the command line:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>raco frog -c  *clears any old cached files, don't forget this!*
*then*
raco frog -bp  *if you want to see a preview*
*or just*
raco frog -b  *if you don't*</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If everything looks satisfactory, proceed to step 11. Otherwise, tweak
things as needed and redo the build.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="step-11-sync-your-changes-with-github">Step 11: Sync your changes with Github</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we need to commit and upload our newly built blog to Github to host.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re on Windows or Mac and using the Github client, this can be
done by clicking on our repo, adding a summary and description under
"Uncommitted Changes", clicking "Commit to master", then finally
clicking the Sync button on the upper right.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we&#8217;re on Unixen, we do this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git add -A
git commit -m "Some kind of short description"
git push</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once everything is uploaded, and accounting for a bit of time for Github
itself to recognize that stuff lives there now, we should be able to see
our new blog online at <code>http://[username].github.com</code>!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want any more help with Frog, be sure to check out the
<a href="https://github.com/greghendershott/frog">Frog repo</a>, and if you&#8217;ve any
questions about Git or Github, their help files are surprisingly helpful
and informative. Enjoy!</p>
