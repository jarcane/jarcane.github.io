            <div class="paragraph">
<p>Recently I asked on Twitter about whether it was possible to find work
in functional programming without a degree, seeing as I&#8217;m a functional
programmer and I don&#8217;t have a degree, and was pleasantly surprised to be
contacted by a recruiter who provided some very useful advice on which
languages to look into.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They also asked for a resume, which suddenly brought me to the
realization that I hadn&#8217;t actually yet written a programming-oriented
resume yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I started thinking of how I could write a resume that would actually
highlight my skills thus far as a programmer in an immediately obvious
way, and I think I found an interesting solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s pretty common for UI or graphics designers to hand design their own
resumes; it&#8217;s a very clear and direct way of showing off your own design
skills in an obvious way. Sadly, other than that there&#8217;s little in the
way of options for the rest of us: there&#8217;s loads of templates out there
for making an interesting <em>looking</em> resume, but that&#8217;s not really the
same effect for programmers as it is for a designer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What&#8217;s needed is a way to show off what one is capable of as a
programmer through the medium of the resume itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve quite got that far yet, but I have done what I think
is a close-by solution: showing off one&#8217;s basic capabilities as a
programmer through the medium of how the resume is <em>generated</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, <a href="https://github.com/jarcane/resume.hsy">resume.hsy</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>resume.hsy</code> is a straightforward Heresy program with one goal: to
generate my resume in Markdown format. After just a half-day&#8217;s effort,
it succeeds at it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s not particularly impressive code (and the contortions involved in
generating the output strings are a little ugly), and the output result
is by design, not especially beautiful. The point here isn&#8217;t to make a
beautiful design object, but to present my skills in a clear format
through the lens of a clear example of how I code. The fact that I
designed the language it&#8217;s written in is also part of the point of the
demonstration, inspired by
<a href="https://twitter.com/boothead/status/545886788196507648">the reaction of
one commenter</a> to my original post on Twitter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Admittedly, that last bit is probably also a weakness: nobody codes in
Heresy yet except me. But the Markdown output is readily available, and
the code is mostly readable to anyone familiar with Lisp, and I&#8217;m also
very proud of having written the first example of useful code in Heresy.</p>
