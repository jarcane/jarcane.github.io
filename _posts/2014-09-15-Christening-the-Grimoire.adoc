Welcome to Arcane Syntax, destined to be the new home of all things
relating to the arcane art of computer programming and development, as
flowing from the mind of myself, an self-trained apprentice programmer,
Finnish language student, and former tabletop games writer.

The chief subject matter of Arcane Syntax is likely at this point to be
focusing especially on the Racket programming language, which has
ultimately proved my favorite home in the magical land of Lisp dialects,
for reasons which I shall expound upon in my next post.

I have been at this programming thing for but a short time, having
previously not touched more than a few simple dice rollers in at least a
decade. If something I should happen to post on this blog demonstrate a
profound ignorance, it is likely for lack of education, and thus polite
instruction is likely to be welcomed eagerly.
