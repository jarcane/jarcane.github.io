I am 34 years old.

34.

Nearing half the average life expectancy in much of the Western world. 

When I was 13 years old I once predicted, and held for some time, that I would die by the age of 35. That deadline is just 8 months away. 

I was 32 years old before I had my first real relationship, before I first made love, before my first proper kiss. 

I have loved many women, but only one has ever used the words "I love you" in return.
