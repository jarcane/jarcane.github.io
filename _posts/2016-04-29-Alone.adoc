When I was 13 years old I once predicted, and held for some time, that I would die by the age of 35. That deadline is just 8 months away. 

I am 34 years old.

34.

I was 31 years old before I had my first relationship. 

31 years old before the first, and so far only woman, to say "I love you" to me.

32 before my first proper kiss. 

32 before I first made love.

It is a standard piece of advice you will hear many times when you are single, and especially after a break-up or a divorce, that you must somehow become reaccustomed to being alone.
