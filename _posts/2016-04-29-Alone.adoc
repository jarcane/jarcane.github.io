= Alone
:hp-tags: personal


When I was 13 years old I once predicted, and held for some time, that I would die by the age of 35. That deadline is just 8 months away. 

I am 34 years old.

34.

I was 31 years old before I had my first relationship. 

32 before my first proper kiss. 

32 before I first made love.

I have of course loved many women, but only that one has ever used the words "I love you" in return.
