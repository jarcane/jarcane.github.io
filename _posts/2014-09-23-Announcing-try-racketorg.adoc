:hp-tags: announcements, Racket


It is my pleasure to announce that at long last, Racket has an online
REPL. I've taken it upon myself to acquire a domain and a DigitalOcean
droplet, and hosted the long-mothballed Try Racket code which you can
find at http://try-racket.org. The PLT folks have also kindly offered an
alternate URL at http://try.racket-lang.org.

I've also taken up the responsibility of maintaining the code: I had to
fork it by necessity to modify some things necessary to get it to run
without X, and as the original maintainer had no interest in pursuing it
further than that, he asked me if I'd like to take over. You can thus
find my fork of it https://github.com/jarcane/try-racket[here], where
future issues and development should take place.

The code's still a bit rough, with a number of issues to be resolved,
and I welcome any and all contributions to the code; pull requests will
be tested and then accepted so long as they don't appear to be breaking
anything. In particular, it seems the memory constraints for the sandbox
need revision to prevent a server crash, and there is some amount of
demand for proper multi-line entry in the style of the offline Racket
REPL. The tutorial is a bit tedious without it at present.
