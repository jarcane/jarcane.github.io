= A Fairy Tale
:hp-tags: personal, writing

Once upon a time there was a boy, and he was afraid.

He was a small boy. A lonely boy.

He was not big and strong like some of the boys he knew, nor was he fast and agile, or handsome and strong. When a fight came to him, he knew that he would not win, and he lost many fights.

He lost fights against the other boys. He lost fights against his teachers. He lost fights against his parents. 

It hurt him to lose, made his heart ache, but it was not the pain of the bullies who struck him that hurt most, but the losing itself.

The boy felt as if he were nothing, as if he had no power at all, and because he had no power at all he saw little need for friends or other people, who had mostly only ever hurt him.
