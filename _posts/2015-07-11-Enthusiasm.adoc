I honestly believe this is what happened to Howard Dean too. I was excited about Dean, he was the first candidate in my adult life who displayed anything like passion or enthusiasm or conviction.

The media drove him out of the race based entirely on footage of one enthusiastic shout.

I wonder what the modern media would've made of Teddy Roosevelt.
