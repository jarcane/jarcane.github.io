I cried this morning. 

I didn't know precisely why even, at the time. I was attempting moments before to look up options for our next meal on the internet. My wife stepped out on to the balcony, and while she was out there, I started weeping. 

After some time of this, when she had returned and asked me what was the matter, and I had managed to pull myself together enough to croak out a response, I said this:

"Everything is terrible."

My wife suggested that this was merely the depression talking. As Vonnegut might've said, my brain was producing bad chemicals again.
